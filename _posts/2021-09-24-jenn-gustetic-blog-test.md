Since the passage of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act in 2010, the U.S. government has run over 1,200 prize competitions - engaging public solvers ranging from students and hobbyists to small business owners and academic researchers. 

Jarah Meador, Director of Open Innovation at the General Services Administration and leader of Challenge.Gov, sat down with Jenn Gustetic, Director of Early Stage Innovations and Partnerships within NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, to reflect on over 10 years of challenges and prize competitions under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act and what the future holds for open innovation in the federal government.

This conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.
 
#### Jarah Meador
Can you share with us a bit about your background and what led you to NASA?

#### Jenn Gustetic
As a kid, starting in late middle school, I was fascinated by space. I studied aerospace engineering in college because I found myself intrigued by math and science. But I didn't think I would work for NASA. 

When I came out of graduate school, I focused on other topic areas. I worked in the homeland security space for a while, focusing my efforts and my passion around innovation and public-private partnership in that domain. I started to apply those same innovative approaches to how we do business to other domains and topic areas through the Open Government Initiative, where I got to know some folks at NASA through the Open Government working group OMB convened at the time. Through that, I ended up getting hired at NASA as the Prizes and Challenges Program Executive, where I was NASA’s first prizes and challenges coordinator for the whole agency. 

Based on that experience, I went over to the White House for a couple of years. There I led open innovation for the whole government trying to help advance our use of prizes and challenges, citizen science, crowdsourcing, and other mechanisms to engage the public in problem-solving.

And then, I came back to NASA in 2016. I stayed in the innovation world but with our Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) program. I was in that role for about five years before getting into this new role in November 2020. The portfolio I now lead includes SBIR/STTR, open innovation activities such as prizes and challenges, and a whole new portfolio that is newer to me around early-stage innovation at universities. I'm really in a playground right now of all the amazing tools through grants, prizes, contracts, tech transfer, etc that the government has in its toolkit to try to accelerate and advance problem-solving.
 
#### Jarah Meador
We're excited as a community to have you in this role. You've spent a good part of your career working on increasing the use of innovative approaches to advance federal agency missions at various levels. Can you share your insights on the early days of prize competitions and the impact of the passage of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act?

#### Jenn Gustetic
I first joined NASA around the time that the America COMPETES Act passed. NASA had been using prize competitions for years before that because it had a special authority, the Space Act, that allowed it to conduct prizes under certain conditions. From NASA to DARPA and others, there were pockets around the government that experimented with various authorities.

When I joined NASA, the America COMPETES Act—plus this experimentation that agencies had been doing on their own—acted like lighter fluid for the agencies looking to find new mechanisms that would allow them to try to pay only for performance or outcomes. There was a keen interest at the highest levels of government, and the COMPETES Act came when there was an interest in pursuing problem-solving that way.

Having examples of where it had worked helped build a case for agencies around the government to say, “hey, we want to try this”. From 2010 to 2014, there were a few hundred prizes conducted. Two years later, from 2014 to 2016, when I was at the White House, the number of prize competitions more than doubled. So, we're talking about an exponential rise. It doubled not only because certain agencies were developing capabilities and were using many of them more frequently, like HHS and USAID and others, but also because brand new agencies were trying them out. The legal authority underpinned the ability to do that. However, cross-government support was made available by programs like Challenge.Gov at GSA and NASA's Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation that offered a contract vehicle for agencies to quickly be able to access a vendor to run a challenge with expertise from the NASA community. 

And so, in reflection on the more than 10 years since the passage of the America COMPETES Act, we continue to see that growth. It's not like a fad that was only from 2008 to 2016; it's continued to grow and find new corners in the government. And more vendors are coming online offering these services, too. There’s a healthy marketplace of ways to approach solving problems in this way. It’s been encouraging to see the continued growth and advocacy for these tools from various places around the government. 

One area that is also particularly promising is to see the Hill’s continued interest in crafting and including a specific desire for prizes at the agencies they oversee to solve problems that are important to bring new ideas to the table. Over recent years, there are so many examples where particular bills have authorized new prize programs or where Congress has appropriated new prize funds. The interest for this tool is truly a bipartisan approach to engaging more folks in sourcing innovation to solve some of our nation's most pressing problems.

#### Jarah Meador
You've written about the eight common challenges to scaling innovation. The critical elements that you presented ranged from policy framework, infrastructure, platforms, knowledge sharing, and a focus on impact assessment. With a decade of prize competitions behind us, and with more than 1,200 that have been posted on Challenge.Gov alone, do those common challenges still ring true to you? Or do you see some additional challenges that we're going to face?

#### Jenn Gustetic
Two areas ring even more true now as areas where we need more work as a community. The first is around budget; the second is around skill development and community building.
On budget, for example, many agencies still struggle with color of money issues. Meaning what money they have available, for how long, and the rules around how long they can hold on to that money for the particular purpose or prize competition.

For example, say an agency wants to run a prize. They're getting up to the end of the year. They have some extra money, and they say, “Hey, let's do a prize.” Everybody's excited about it. Then they realize their 1 year funding is about to expire and they can't obligate this prize money unless it is run through an external partner. Often with prizes, especially the bigger ones, unless you're using milestone-based approaches where you're making incremental payments, you need that money available for a while because you don't know if that prize will take six months, two years, or four years. You need the funding to be available when someone wins—and those deadlines will depend on the ambition of a particular prize. Sometimes folks are forced into structuring an activity a certain way because of the color of money and because they have to go through intermediaries, instead of structuring it to achieve the goal the most effectively. These funding availability issues across agencies could be addressed through administrative provisions that extend the life of prize funds.

On community building, I would always say that it felt like, and it may still feel like, prizes are hand-to-hand combat every time. Even if your agency's done it before, there might be a new attorney or a new person for public affairs or a new big boss overseeing the budget. Every time, you have to justify why this different approach is useful in this particular case and why it's not a risk.

There have been 1,200 of these things. You can go through the library of examples, and I guarantee you there's an example that relates to the thing you're trying to do. The most powerful way that I was able to pitch agencies or senior leaders on using this approach is by pulling examples relevant to them to do the myth-busting. Having a library of stories in the back pocket and finding those easily is important for people to continue making the case for using prize competitions. 

That storytelling part of community building is very different from the skill development side of being a prize designer. Prize designers need to learn a new set of processes and fight a new set of battles around prizes. On top of that, they need to develop problem definition skills that might perhaps be a little different than the traditional way to approach problem-solving in the government.  

Is it on those individuals to expand their toolset? Or do we centralize certain parts of that through centers of excellence? I think we still struggle with what is most appropriate to centralize or make available through centers of excellence and what is a skill that is important to build across the workforce. 

That's one of the major barriers to scaling in my mind. What is the individual innovator's job to do? What is not? What expertise can they access elsewhere? And do they need to pay for it? This sentiment gets to the point earlier about budget, cost, and resources. There are challenges associated with timing, when there is the opportunity and when you have the resources to do it, which might not be at the same time. Then, determining how we do a better job at scaling the transfer of skills. Those are all complicated problems.
 
#### Jarah Meador
Sage advice, Jenn, on how we can operationalize the use of prize competitions by lowering barriers around budget and also thinking about where centralized knowledge needs to live, whether inside a government agency or broadly across the ecosystem of federal agencies who work in innovation.

I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier when you described your new role and how now you're working with the bevy of tools. Where do you see prize competitions and open innovation fitting in with your approach at NASA?

#### Jenn Gustetic
We have several different approaches we use in NASA'S early-stage innovation and partnership portfolio. We are sourcing ideas from all over the country, whether that's universities, small businesses, large businesses, individual innovators, or makers. The beauty of the approaches in this portfolio is that we can source from anywhere.

However, we've got different siloed approaches for sourcing through different programs. A challenge is how you create opportunities for partnership across sectors and how you create opportunities for transition between vehicles. What might be an on-ramp for one type of person or organization is not necessarily the place where they're going to get the continued support that they need to develop that technology, that capability, their company, or their idea to a place where it's real innovation and not just an invention. 

Prizes, along with SBIR/STTR, advance problem solving and technology across the entire technology readiness level (TRL) spectrum. Prizes can certainly seek early-stage concepts and ideas. But, competitions and crowdsourcing activities can also leverage a community outside of the government workforce to access on-demand talent to address higher TRL needs. These open innovation tools can do so much.

There is another major opportunity for improvement in the open innovation world over the upcoming decade—in how winning ideas and teams transition and develop. This approach sits in a critical nexus of sourcing innovation from anywhere. You don't have to work at a university. You don't have to work at a company; if you compete and you win, the award is just going to you as an individual. You don’t need to be in a special government registration database to get paid. That's a very special tool for the government, but brings a different set of challenges. When you start to work with that one person, how do you have off-ramps for that one person's idea or activity? How do you help someone else take that idea along or make connections to some other organization to continue to develop the capability? Sometimes those off-ramps and next steps are not as clear as they could be.

I would challenge the community to think about what those off-ramps could be and what barriers exist to those offramps. Streamlining efforts to reduce friction, whether legal, budget, etc, would be important. Prioritizing barriers those and working on some intentionally as a community would be a priority that would be important to continue making prizes more impactful moving forward. 
 
#### Jarah Meador
I appreciate that answer and how you so clearly described the different tools or mechanisms for sourcing innovation.

I have one more question to leave us with. What have prize competitions allowed agencies to accomplish in your experience that could not have been accomplished otherwise?

#### Jenn Gustetic
There are many different ways in which prizes have benefits beyond the standard toolkit of the federal government. One of those benefits is access to people that you wouldn't otherwise access through a funded mechanism. Another benefit is specifying the outcome without paying for the work along the way; you only pay for results. 

There has been an evolution in how we practice prizes. NASA has done this too, where we use a more milestone-based payment approach. Instead of getting to the big outcome, like a big $10 million XPRIZE-type outcome, we look for ways to break it up into stages and enable some funding along the way. That way, we can level the playing field in some ways for some people that might not be as resourced as the teams that can bear that amount of upfront investment. It allows people to participate and be rewarded along the way and demonstrate progress towards a goal. But we’re still only paying for results. They just might be more incremental results along the way. 

There's also energy around prize competitions that's completely different. NASA has been doing prizes for almost 20 years, and people still think they are so cool. They love to participate in them, and the energy in these competitions continues to be contagious. There is an energy around it that attracts external innovators and innovators inside of the government that are looking to perhaps try something a little different. Those benefits cannot be underestimated.
Another recommendation I have for moving prize competitions forward is that we will only grow these outcomes if we take advantage of our opportunity to partner cross-government and cross-sector on prize competitions. 

The America COMPETES Act offers the ability to co-fund prizes with partners outside of government, and different ways to partner with external groups to advance mutual objectives which then leverage their networks, their energy, their joint purpose, and joint passion. They can act as amplifiers to advance the outcomes that are coming out of these competitions that go beyond just what the government sees as being part of the problem. 

I would challenge the community to think more ambitiously about leveraging partnerships and authorities that are available to all agencies through the use of COMPETES prize competitions. It's a huge opportunity, and we've seen a number of them, but not nearly as many as you would think, in part because of the budget and skills challenges that we've talked about earlier. I would say this is a great, largely unrealized, opportunity to get outcomes that you can't get with other tools.

#### Jarah Meador
Thank you, Jenn. I appreciate you taking the time to share your insights. I look forward to continuing our collaboration and seeing where the future takes you in your role at NASA.
